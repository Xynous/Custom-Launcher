Compiling:

1. To compile this project simply open the project within visual studio (I used visual studio 2015 community edition), and then select the release option (Next to the "Any CPU" drop box) and then simply build the solution by going to the build tab and select build solution. 

2. Note that the installer may not compile but the application will, if you want to compile to the installer simply right click the installer within the solution explorer (on the right of the screen) and then simply select build and it will build the installer for you.

3. You will find the compiled application executable within "ArmA3 Launcher\bin\Release\" and the compiled installer will be found within "installer\Release\"

4. If you compiled the application within debug mode, then you will find them within the "Debug" folder instead of the "Release" folder.

Notes:

If you have trouble installing or using our launcher, make sure you got the latest.net framework and also do check windows update as this does some of the process for you.

Your free to use our code and launcher as long we get the credits for our work and we will not take any responsibility for any problems what occur with our code/launcher as this has been tested and works fine.
